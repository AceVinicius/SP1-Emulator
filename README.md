# SP1-Emulator

To install all dependencies run:
```console
$ bash dependencies.sh
```

After that, assuming all libraries was successfully installed, run:
```console
$ bash run.sh
```

Additional assemblies can be compiled adding them to './src/test/' folder. The changes you'll need to do is simply open 'run.sh' and add in 'Compile assembly files' the new file you've added and the name of the file in 'Run SP1_Emulator'.
